# SundePhish

**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:** this project was developed for educational purposes, to showcase how easy it is to create a simple website clone of a popular service in order to trick users into submitting their details. It can only be used under the pretext of a licensed and agreed upon penetration test for which the client is aware of, and accepts potential liabilities.

Do not attempt to violate the law with anything contained here. If your plan is to use this repository to conduct illegal activities, please leave and don't come back. I will not be held responsible for your illegal actions.

Misuse of this project can result in criminal charges brought against you. In this case, you will most likely be prosecuted and punished to the fullest extend permitted by law.

This is for educational purposes only. The use of this project is limited to education, research, and licensed, legal and permitted penetration tests.

If you do not listen and continue to use this work outside of its intended scope, you're not cool. You're a criminal who deserves to be punished for your wrongdoings. Hurting others with your skills is a waste of talent. Instead, come join us on the white hat side, where we use our skills and talent for the benefit of society. That's what makes you cool. And that's what will bring you the most respect among your peers.

If you're interested in using those skills for good reasons, consider checking out programs such as [EC-Council's Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)](https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/). This, and similar courses, will teach you all that is needed in order to launch a successful career in cybersecurity.

Once again, don't be a jerk. You've been warned.
